# Frog loves asking creatures he encoutners what they like to eat.
# Meets the alligator who loves to eat wide-mouthed frogs!
# When he meets the alligator, it makes a tiny mouth.

# Goal is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argumenta nimal which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog.
# If this one is an alligator (case insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.
